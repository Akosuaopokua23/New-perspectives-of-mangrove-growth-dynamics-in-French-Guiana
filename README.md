# New-perspectives-of-mangrove-growth-dynamics-in-French-Guiana
Fits multiple growth models to DBH data; computes R2, AIC, RMSE, MAE; produces plots.
This repository provides an R script for fitting multiple nonlinear growth models to Avicennia (French Guiana) tree data, computing model diagnostics (R², AIC, RMSE, MAE), and visualizing results. The script is fully reproducible and ready for collaborative ecological/statistical modeling workflows.
Features

    Implements six parametric growth models for tree DBH over stand age

    Calculates R², AIC, RMSE, and MAE for model comparison and manuscript-ready tables

    Generates publication-quality plots with bootstrapped confidence intervals

    Code is structured for clarity, reproducibility, and extensibility

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    R version 4.0 or higher

    The following R packages, which will be installed automatically by the script if missing:

        ggplot2

        minpack.lm

        gridExtra
