R scripts and workflows to fit and compare six parametric stand biomass and growth models for French Guiana mangrove chronosequences. Models are fitted to field and remotely-sensed inventory data for Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora spp., estimating stand-level above-ground biomass dynamics using nonlinear regression and bootstrapped confidence intervals. Code outputs metrics (RÂ²/AIC/RMSE), publishes model selection tables, and visualizes fitted trajectories and prediction uncertainty.
